        <h1>Online Resturant</h1>
        <h2>Group 1: <ul>
            <li>Alex Adamson</li>
            <li>Alicia Bashura</li>
            <li>Oscar Godlewski</li>
            <li>Liban Guled</li>
            <li>Abdur Rob Majumder</li>
            </ul>
        </h2>
        <p>Welcome to our online resturant! Here in group 1, we're excited to offer you the meals that have stuck with us through the ages,
            gourmet cuisine that transports you to a different place with a single bite, dishes that inspire us.
            Food can bring anybody together. You might not like your racist uncle, but you both love cheesy potatoes.
        </p>
        <p>Basically I thought it'd be super easy to just make webpages about our favourite foods and make it like we can actually order them at a resturant.
            AdminView would offer things like
            </p><ul>
                <li>Summary of all products sold</li>
                <li>Total revenue view for day, week, month, year</li>
                <li>Add/delete products</li>
                <li>Easy price changes for flash promotions</li>
                <li>Loyalty Program functions</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>give customer points</li>
                        <li>Enable extra points when certain things are bought</li>
                    </ul>
            </ul>

            CustomerView would offer things like
            <ul>
                <li>Order History</li>
                <li>Convenient "buy again" button</li>
                <li>Edit a previous order and sumbit (say you wanted the same combo but a different pop)</li>
                <li>Payment Information</li>
                <li>Loyalty Program Overview</li>
            </ul>
            A menu would always be available for viewing and you don't need to sign in to place an order. Signing in however
            gives you loyalty points.
        <p></p>
        <!-- Software specifications are not solid, just wanted to write something down-->
        <p>We would use a database like mySQL to store customer information. We can take "payments" through
